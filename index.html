			<h1> I Seen It </h1>
				<p> This one time in band camp, a flying frog-cat came outta nowhere and slapped me in the forehead.  I did not know what to do so I just chilled on the beach and started skipping rocks.</p>
				<p>"That's cray," is all I had to say.  I don't remember much else, maybe that didn't even happen.  I don't even know what a frog cat is.</p>

			<h1>Did I learn anything</h1>	
				<p>I walked away from band camp without learning anything. Life is random and there is truly nothing to make of it.</p>
